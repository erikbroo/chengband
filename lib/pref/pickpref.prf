# Turning on leave_excellent and we keep all egos by default
# thanks to the following line, but you may want to narrow
# down which egos to keep.
# I use unidentified since I might want to auto-destroy weapons
# of slay orc, or other useless egos, and that should trigger
# after I identify the object.
~unidentified ego

# If you just want ego weapons:
#~unidentified ego weapons
#~ego more than 19

# If you just want ego armors:
#~unidentified ego armors

# If you just want ego bolts:
#~unidentified ego bolt


#
# I usually turn leave_excellent on and uncomment
# the following 2 lines about midway thru the game.
# Note that order is important. The line '~unidentified ego'
# must come before '!unidentified weapons' since both will
# match on an excellent dagger, for example. As always, first
# match wins.
#
#!unidentified weapons
#!unidentified armors

# To summarize with an example:
# [1] '!unidentified weapons' matches as I step onto a grid with an
#     unknown dagger.
# [2] When the game tries to destroy the dagger, it discovers it is an
#     ego weapon, and notices that leave_excellent is turned on.
# [3] The object then is pseudo-identified as 'excellent' and preferences
#     are rescanned for a new match.
# [4] The line '~unidentified ego' is found 
#     (before '!unidentified weapons'), so the object is not destroyed.
# [5] I identifiy the weapon, to find it is a Dagger of Slay Animal.
# [6] The game rescans the preferences and finds the match of
#     '(!common ego weapons:of slay animal' and destroys the weapon
#
